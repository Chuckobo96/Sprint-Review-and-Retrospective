I can interpret user needs simply by anaylsis. By asking feedback from coders of older user stories, I can more or less infer on what kind of modifications I should make to comply with the current user needs. In doing so, I can implement them into a program using the specified inputs and outputs for the system. By building on a user story, I can make an educated guess on the user needs as well. Their old code gives me an insight into what sort of features they were trying to make. With that, I can improve upon the code and successfully fulfill a user story.
The way I approach developing programs is through the use of various project management strategies. The Waterfall Method was a common strategy used before the introduction of Agile Methodology. It had well-structured and well-defined vision for any given project but lacked flexiblility of any kind when unexpected changes or issues arose. As a result, more companies and teams such as my own are incoporating agile methodology into our strategies when focusing on the long-term scope of a project. To be a good team member in development software, one has to follow the team standards and philosophies set during the actual project run.
